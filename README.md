I did two of the bonus features. These are joker and point system.(If user select the correct answer in 5 secons gets 200, if user select the correct answer in 10 secons gets 100 points and if user select the correct answer in more than 10 seconds gets 50 points. )

In the project directory, you can run:

npm install to install all dependencies

and after that

npm start to run the app.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
